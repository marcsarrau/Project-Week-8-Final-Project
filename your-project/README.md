## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to have an understanding and predict if sentiment analysis in social media can be performed with certainty.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* What does people think of skincare?
* Does it really work?
* How is sentiment analysis algorithm interpreting human feelings at a large scale?
* Can I do a better model to predict the coefficient of negativity?

## Dataset
I have scraped more than 12,000 tweets of the words and hashtags skincare, acne, maskne, accutane and skincare routine. 

## Cleaning
I have followed the usual pattern: removing stopwords, stemming, lemmatizing, tokenizing and making a bag of words and perform sentiment analysis

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
I tried 3 different models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree. The best results were achieved with the Decision Tree Regressor predicting the negativity coefficient. 

## Conclusion
* There is room for word classification improvement and NLP should interpret jargons.
* There is a large applicability of the model accross the industry and also, it would be ideal to better know the public opinion.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
